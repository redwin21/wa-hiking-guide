# Data Analysis and Modeling Process

The analysis of the data was done in the following steps:

1. Exploratory data analysis was performed in the `eda.ipynb` file.

2. Natural language processing using K-Means Clustering and Non-negative Matrix Factorization was performed on the hiking description feature in the `description_nlp.ipynb` file. This determined whether a hike is technical or not. This technical feature was added to the data.

3. A Ridge Resgression model was used to predict the rating and reports features in the `lr_model.ipynb` file.

4. A Gradient Boosting Resgression model was used to predict the rating and reports features in the `gbr_model.ipynb` file.

Details on the results and conclusions can be seen in the main repository `README.md`.
