With updates to the data and soem additional analysis, a next step for this project would be to create a hiking recommender. The recommender would act in real time to determine the best hike for a person at a certain time. It would have the following attributes:

- draw overall insights from all previous trip reports to include user sentiment about a hike and determine the best times of year
- pull the latest trip reports and perform sentiment analysis to determine if hiking conditions are currently good
- draw on the current weather forecast to determine if the weather will be appropriate at a given hike
