With hiking being so popular, there are constants efforts made to build new trails, maintain current trails, and rescue estranged hikers who lose their way. Information on why a hike is so popular can help focus resources to the best locations. It can also be used for developing new hikes in places outside of Washington.

The following models, and overall study, are meant to provide insight into what makes a hike so popular. Feature importance can be extracted from models that make predictions on popularity quanitities to make draw these insights.

## Next Steps

With updates to the data and soem additional analysis, a next step for this project would be to create a hiking recommender. The recommender would act in real time to determine the best hike for a person at a certain time. It would have the following attributes:

- draw overall insights from all previous trip reports to include user sentiment about a hike and determine the best times of year
- pull the latest trip reports and perform sentiment analysis to determine if hiking conditions are currently good
- draw on the current weather forecast to determine if the weather will be appropriate at a given hike
